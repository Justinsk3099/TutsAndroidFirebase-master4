 Firebase So backend database so I had to different package name
 This project is designed to retrieve users from GitHub if the user has used his/her valid credentials for login 
 users can search with respect to username  
 I'm sorry I wonâ€™t be able to update the app for some time because my exams are near and if I don't clear it, it would cost some amount for re-exam
 exam dates were declared yesterday so some mock test would be conducted so I need to prepare for that as well
